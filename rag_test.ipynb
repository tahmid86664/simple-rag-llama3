      "The reddish hue you're observing in the sky just before sunset is called \"sunset glow\" or \"sundowner.\" It's a common phenomenon that occurs when the sun is low on the horizon, typically during the last hour or so before sundown. Here are some reasons why this happens:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Atmospheric scattering**: When the sun's rays enter Earth's atmosphere, they encounter tiny molecules of gases like nitrogen and oxygen. These molecules scatter shorter (blue) wavelengths of light more than longer (red) wavelengths, a phenomenon known as Rayleigh scattering. As the sun dips lower in the sky, the light it emits has to travel longer distances through the atmosphere, which means more blue light is scattered away, leaving mainly red and orange hues.\n",
      "2. **Dust and aerosols**: Tiny particles like dust, pollen, and other aerosols in the air can also scatter shorter wavelengths of light, enhancing the reddish color. These particles are often more abundant near sunset due to human activities or natural sources like wildfires.\n",
      "3. **Clouds and haze**: If there are clouds or haze in the atmosphere, they can reflect and scatter the sun's rays, adding to the redness of the sky.\n",
      "4. **Angular perspective**: When the sun is low on the horizon, our line of sight is more oblique (angled) relative to the sun. This means we're seeing the light as it passes through a thicker layer of atmosphere, which can amplify the reddish hue.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the combination of atmospheric scattering, dust and aerosols, clouds and haze, and angular perspective all contribute to the reddish color you see in the sky just before sunset!\n",
